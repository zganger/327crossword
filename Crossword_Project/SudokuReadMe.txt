How to Install SUDOKU327

Installing via the Play Store is the easiest method (https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.sudoku327&hl=en). However, source code and an APK are available at http://code.google.com/p/327crossword/source/checkout.
To build from source, checkout with SVN and compile with the tool of your choice; project files for Android Studio and Eclipse ADT are included.
To install the APK, simply download it to the device of your choice. Once downloaded, all you need to do is select the APK file and your device should install it automatically. (Make sure you allow installation of apps from sources other than the Play Store in your device's security settings if you want to install SUDOKU327 using the APK directly.)
